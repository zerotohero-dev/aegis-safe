## Aegis Safe

**Safe** (`aegis-safe`) is the part that does most of the dirty work:

* It acts as the central in-memory secrets store.
* **Aegis Sentinel** talks to **Aegis Safe** to register secrets.
* **Aegis Sidecar** talks to **Aegis Safe** to get the secrets that the workload needs.

[Check out Aegisâ€™ README][aegis-readme] for more information about the project,
high level design, contributing guidelines, and code of conduct.
