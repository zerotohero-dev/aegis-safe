#
# `safe-age-key` is a critical secret. Make sure you keep it secure, and also
# make sure you periodically take incremental backups of this secret to a
# secure location.
#
# Note that Kubernetes Secrets are, by default, stored unencrypted in the
# API server's underlying data store (etcd). As a preventative measure, it
# is recommended to keep the data on `etcd` encrypted. However, merely
# encrypting `etcd` has minimal effect in terms of your threat landscape unless
# you also secure your secrets with proper RBAC and network policies.
#
# By default, anyone with API access can retrieve or modify a Secret,
# and so can anyone with access to etcd. Additionally, anyone who is
# authorized to create a Pod in a namespace can use that access to read any
# Secret in that namespace; this includes indirect access such as the ability
# to create a Deployment.
#
# Also, note that, keeping your secrets secure is a must-have for your production
# Kubernetes is a separate and orthogonal topic to your Aegis usage. Whether
# you use Aegis or not; you are **strongly encouraged** to take the preventative
# measures outlined below on your cluster as a security best practice.
#
# In order to safely use Secrets, take at least the following steps:
#
# - Enable Encryption at Rest for Secrets
#   (ref: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/encrypt-data/).
# - Enable or configure RBAC rules with least-privilege access to Secrets
#   (ref: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authorization/).
# - Restrict Secret access to specific containers via RBAC (see above).
#
# For more guidelines to manage and improve the security of your Secrets, refer
# to “Good practices for Kubernetes Secrets”
# (ref: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/secrets-good-practices/).
